				<h2>HappyBoba</h2>

            <p>I individually worked on an app to aid users in ordering boba drinks. Many people feel indecisive and want to either stick with their usual order or to try something new but don't know what to get. The random boba generator I implemented helps with randomizing drinks based on types of drinks, tea and toppings. The user can decide whether that sounds good or they can try again. Users can also create lists of boba stores and add their favorite drinks to share with their friends! I developed this app using React Native, JavaScript and Xcode. HappyBoba has been available on the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/vg/app/happyboba/id1477132126">iOS App Store</a> since August 2019 and has over a thousand downloads from over 20 countries!</p><br>

				<h2>Cards For Humanity</h2>
                <span class="byline">March 2019</span> </div>
            <a href="http://students.engr.scu.edu/~ofigueir/h4h/index.html" class="image1"><img src="images/pic03.jpg" alt="" /></a>
            <p>My team and I participated in <a href="https://hackforhumanity.io">Hack for Humanity</a>, a 24-hour hackathon at Santa Clara University. We were chosen as one of two finalists out of more than 30 teams in the education category.</p></br><p>Our goal was to create an educational platform that debunks social misconceptions by using decks of cards. In a world where information is quickly accessed and easy to come by, it has also become increasingly easy to become misinformed. People have begun to trust websites that seem unbiased and trustworthy, along with social media posts with no verified sources. Some misguided views surround social issues such as sex and gender, race and ethnicity, and health issues.</p></br><p>To tackle these issues, my team and I decided to focus on the top issues we have seen controversy over and put all the related misconceptions in one place. After doing thorough research, we created a deck of cards for each topic, and when the user hovers over a card on the website or clicks on a card on the app, they can learn what the reality of the matter is. We used HTML and CSS for the website and Xcode and Swift for the iOS app. My role was to help create the app! We hope to build on this project and turn it into a game to attract a larger audience and make an impact on the way people treat social misconceptions.</p></br><p>Check out our project on <a href="https://devpost.com/software/cards-for-humanity-tvfngs">Devpost</a> and <a href="https://github.com/ofigueira/CardsForHumanity">GitHub</a>.</p></br>

				<h2>Independent Study</h2>
				<span class="byline">April 2019 - Present</span> </div>
			<p>After watching our presentation at the hackathon, an SCU professor in the Computer Science and Engineering Department reached out to my hackathon team to ask if we would be interested in continuing to develop our project with the goal of deploying it in rural communities in Africa through her existing partnership with <a href="https://roseacademies.org">Rose Academies</a>. In the next quarter after the hackathon, we began our Independent Study with her, and our goal was to learn Javascript, React Native, Android Studio, and Databases to turn the project into an educational game to be deployed in rural communities in Africa to teach young kids about pressing issues. We will be continuing to work with this professor in the 2019-2020 academic year.</p>
