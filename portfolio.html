                  <p>In the summer of 2020, I interned at Liberty Mutual Insurance as a software engineer in the Global Retail Markets (GRM) Agent and Partners Tech team. I worked in an agile environment on a team of 8 developers to modernize the Customer Service Workbench application, which is a website for users to view their insurance policies. This was a Java legacy website that could only run on Internet Explorer, and my team and I were working to modernize it. 
                </p><br>
                  <p>On the team’s Jira board, I was responsible for full-stack development tickets. I used React and JavaScript to develop a user interface (UI) for customers to easily view their insurance policies as well as their expiration dates. One of the features I implemented was to calculate an insurance surcharge expiration date in the Incident Review Page, where users can view their current and past insurance policies. To do this, I had to open up the Java legacy code to figure out how it should be calculated in order to translate that into JavaScript code. After completing the task, I proceeded to write unit tests using mock data to check the React components’ functionality. The rest of the ticket involved code reviews from other developers in order to optimize the code, as well as meetings with the product owner to demo and deliver the feature to production. 
                </p><br>
                <p>In addition to implementing technical features to production, I worked on the UI for the modernized website. I designed website mockups, components, and prototypes using Sketch and Liberty Mutual’s design library. I participated in meetings with customer representatives who would be using the website at call centers in order to get feedback on the design and the usability of its functionalities. Upon collecting feedback, the next step was to implement all of the design components into code. I was able to export the designs from Sketch into cascading style sheets (CSS) that would be used in the new website. After importing the CSS into the new website and implementing the UI and front-end development with React and JavaScript, it is now modernized to be compatible with all browsers and is much easier to use. The new website is used by over 10,000 customer service representatives at call centers daily.

                    <p>My team and I worked with the <a href="https://www.scu.edu/engineering/labs--research/labs/frugal-innovation-hub/" target="_blank">Frugal Innovation Hub at SCU</a> and <a href="https://roseacademies.org" target="_blank">Rose Academies</a> to further develop our “Cards for Humanity” Hackathon idea <a href="#c4h">(see Cards for Humanity project below)</a> idea into an app to educate children and teenagers in rural Uganda about common misconceptions, such as those regarding health and hygiene. Rose Academies is a non-profit organization that works exclusively with local communities in Uganda to educate and empower women, children, and the disabled through innovative and frugal solutions, similar to the mission of the Frugal Innovation Hub. 
                    </p><br>
                    <p>In further developing the application, I had to understand who the users would be and how they would be able to  effectively learn using our application given their technological skills and geographic location. The initial issues we came across were that Rose Academies teachers in Uganda only had Android tablets and that the community members had little to no experience with applications as we know them. Therefore, extensive user experience (UX) research and design was needed to better understand how we could effectively design this product so that the users could easily learn how to use it and actually benefit from it. To customize the app to fit with the demographics, the name “UkweliCards” was chosen, which translates to “TruthCards” in Swahili, the language spoken by the target community in Uganda. 
                    </p><br>
                    <p>After many months of work, we successfully created a game for Android that presents a “myth” and “truth” card and asks the user to click the one that is true, and upon the user’s selection, it will show the correct answer and an explanation in order to teach the user about the topic. At the end of each round, the user is shown their results, and from there they can keep playing and learn more about other topics in the game. We recently updated the application to include information about COVID-19 in order to combat the spread of the virus and misinformation in Uganda. </p><br>
                    <p>We obtained our data from Rose Academies and used Google Firebase’s real-time database to store information. We specifically chose a real-time database since internet access is limited in rural Uganda, so we needed our Android app to update its card information whenever there is wifi. If there is no wifi connection, the app will keep its current information and sync with the database later. To make changes to the data, we developed a website using HTML and CSS for administrators to access. The website is connected to the database and uses Firebase’s authentication feature to verify users upon logging in. Verified users can then add, remove, or edit data. The database is also linked to the Android application, which displays the cards and updates its information whenever there is internet access. The Android application was developed using JavaScript, React Native, and Android Studio. UkweliCards is projected to launch in Spring 2022 and will be used by over a hundred students and teachers partnered with Rose Academies.

                    <p>I spent the summer of 2019 developing my own app, “Happy Boba.” Because of the growth of and interest in the tea-based drink known as boba, more people are trying out different boba shops and are often indecisive about what to order. To address this, I wanted to create an app with a random boba drink generator in addition to a boba log, in which users can save their favorite orders so they can remember their favorite drinks. The random boba generator I implemented helps with randomizing drinks based on types of milk, tea and toppings. The user can decide whether that sounds good or they can try again. I started by researching potential user demographics and what the core functionalities should be. Before beginning the implementation, I learned how to design and prototype using Figma and how to create graphic designs for my logo using Microsoft PowerPoint, as I did not have access to traditional graphic design tools. I enjoyed creating mockups as well as my own components that I used to design the user interface (UI). I developed all the components and functionality using JavaScript, React Native, and Xcode and got my app onto the iOS App Store at the end of the summer. As of January 2021, “Happy Boba” has over 1,000 downloads from over 20 countries in the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/vg/app/happyboba/id1477132126">iOS App Store</a>.

                    <p>My team and I participated in <a href="https://hackforhumanity.io" target="_blank">Hack for Humanity</a>, a 24-hour hackathon at Santa Clara University. For my hackathon project, I worked in a team to develop an iOS app and website to educate people on social misconceptions. With so much information propagating on the internet, it can be difficult to distinguish between what is credible and what is misinformation. To tackle this issue, we designed a game called “Cards for Humanity,” which is a play on words of the popular card game “Cards Against Humanity”, as we created a card game as a fun way for users to learn, rather than just presenting them with information . We designed decks of cards with different topics, and each card within a deck contained facts and myths about a related subtopic. We developed the app using Xcode and Swift programming language, the website using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, and the logo and cards using Adobe Illustrator. My team and I became finalists in the hackathon that had over 30 teams participating, and a professor from SCU’s Frugal Innovation Hub who watched our presentation  became interested in further developing our project with the goal of teaching young kids in underserved populations about important topics with the help of a non-profit organization called Rose Academies.
