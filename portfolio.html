                  <p>In the summer of 2020, I interned at Liberty Mutual Insurance as a software engineer in the Global Retail Markets (GRM) Agent and Partners Tech team. I worked in an agile environment on a team of 8 developers to modernize the Customer Service Workbench application, which is a website for users to view their insurance policies. This was a Java legacy website that could only run on Internet Explorer, and my team and I were working to modernize it. 
                </p><br>
                  <p>On the team’s Jira board, I was responsible for full-stack development tickets. I used React and JavaScript to develop a user interface (UI) for customers to easily view their insurance policies as well as their expiration dates. One of the features I implemented was to calculate an insurance surcharge expiration date in the Incident Review Page, where users can view their current and past insurance policies. To do this, I had to open up the Java legacy code to figure out how it should be calculated in order to translate that into JavaScript code. After completing the task, I proceeded to write unit tests using mock data to check the React components’ functionality. The rest of the ticket involved code reviews from other developers in order to optimize the code, as well as meetings with the product owner to demo and deliver the feature to production. 
                </p><br>
                <p>In addition to implementing technical features to production, I worked on the UI for the modernized website. I designed website mockups, components, and prototypes using Sketch and Liberty Mutual’s design library. I participated in meetings with customer representatives who would be using the website at call centers in order to get feedback on the design and the usability of its functionalities. Upon collecting feedback, the next step was to implement all of the design components into code. I was able to export the designs from Sketch into cascading style sheets (CSS) that would be used in the new website. After importing the CSS into the new website and implementing the UI and front-end development with React and JavaScript, it is now modernized to be compatible with all browsers and is much easier to use. The new website is used by over 10,000 customer service representatives at call centers daily.

                    <p>My team and I worked with the <a href="https://www.scu.edu/engineering/labs--research/labs/frugal-innovation-hub/" target="_blank">Frugal Innovation Hub at SCU</a> and <a href="https://roseacademies.org" target="_blank">Rose Academies</a> to further develop our “Cards for Humanity” Hackathon idea <a href="#c4h">(see Cards for Humanity project below)</a> idea into an app to educate children and teenagers in rural Uganda about common misconceptions, such as those regarding health and hygiene. Rose Academies is a non-profit organization that works exclusively with local communities in Uganda to educate and empower women, children, and the disabled through innovative and frugal solutions, similar to the mission of the Frugal Innovation Hub. 
                    </p><br>
                    <p>In further developing the application, I had to understand who the users would be and how they would be able to  effectively learn using our application given their technological skills and geographic location. The initial issues we came across were that Rose Academies teachers in Uganda only had Android tablets and that the community members had little to no experience with applications as we know them. Therefore, extensive user experience (UX) research and design was needed to better understand how we could effectively design this product so that the users could easily learn how to use it and actually benefit from it. To customize the app to fit with the demographics, the name “UkweliCards” was chosen, which translates to “TruthCards” in Swahili, the language spoken by the target community in Uganda. 
                    </p><br>
                    <p>After many months of work, we successfully created a game for Android that presents a “myth” and “truth” card and asks the user to click the one that is true, and upon the user’s selection, it will show the correct answer and an explanation in order to teach the user about the topic. At the end of each round, the user is shown their results, and from there they can keep playing and learn more about other topics in the game. We recently updated the application to include information about COVID-19 in order to combat the spread of the virus and misinformation in Uganda. </p><br>
                    <p>We obtained our data from Rose Academies and used Google Firebase’s real-time database to store information. We specifically chose a real-time database since internet access is limited in rural Uganda, so we needed our Android app to update its card information whenever there is wifi. If there is no wifi connection, the app will keep its current information and sync with the database later. To make changes to the data, we developed a website using HTML and CSS for administrators to access. The website is connected to the database and uses Firebase’s authentication feature to verify users upon logging in. Verified users can then add, remove, or edit data. The database is also linked to the Android application, which displays the cards and updates its information whenever there is internet access. The Android application was developed using JavaScript, React Native, and Android Studio. UkweliCards is projected to launch in Spring 2022 and will be used by over a hundred students and teachers partnered with Rose Academies.

                    <p>I individually worked on an app to aid users in ordering boba drinks. Many people feel indecisive and want to either stick with their usual order or to try something new but don't know what to get. The random boba generator I implemented helps with randomizing drinks based on types of drinks, tea and toppings. The user can decide whether that sounds good or they can try again. Users can also create lists of boba stores and add their favorite drinks to share with their friends! I developed this app using React Native, JavaScript and Xcode. HappyBoba has been available on the <a href="https://apps.apple.com/vg/app/happyboba/id1477132126">iOS App Store</a> since August 2019 and has over a thousand downloads from over 20 countries!</p><br>

                    <p>My team and I participated in <a href="https://hackforhumanity.io" target="_blank">Hack for Humanity</a>, a 24-hour hackathon at Santa Clara University. We were chosen as one of two finalists out of more than 30 teams in the education category.</p></br><p>Our goal was to create an educational platform that debunks social misconceptions by using decks of cards. In a world where information is quickly accessed and easy to come by, it has also become increasingly easy to become misinformed. People have begun to trust websites that seem unbiased and trustworthy, along with social media posts with no verified sources. Some misguided views surround social issues such as sex and gender, race and ethnicity, and health issues.</p></br><p>To tackle these issues, my team and I decided to focus on the top issues we have seen controversy over and put all the related misconceptions in one place. After doing thorough research, we created a deck of cards for each topic, and when the user hovers over a card on the website or clicks on a card on the app, they can learn what the reality of the matter is. We used HTML and CSS for the website and Xcode and Swift for the iOS app. My role was to help create the app! We hope to build on this project and turn it into a game to attract a larger audience and make an impact on the way people treat social misconceptions.</p></br><p>Check out our project <a href="https://ofigueira.github.io/Cards-for-Humanity/index.html" target="_blank">website</a> and on <a href="https://devpost.com/software/cards-for-humanity-tvfngs" target="_blank">Devpost</a> and <a href="https://github.com/ofigueira/CardsForHumanity" target="_blank">GitHub</a>.</p></br>
